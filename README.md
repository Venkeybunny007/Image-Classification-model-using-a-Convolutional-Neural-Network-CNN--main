🧠 Image Classification Model Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)


This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset — a benchmark dataset of handwritten digits (0–9).

🎯 Project Objective
Build a CNN from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras

Train the model on the MNIST dataset

Monitor performance (accuracy/loss)

Evaluate the model on test data

Visualize training progress

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

📁 Dataset
MNIST: 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (28x28 grayscale)

Automatically downloaded via tensorflow.keras.datasets
